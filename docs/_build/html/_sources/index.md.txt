### Example code

This is a simple example that opens Notepad and types 'Hello world!'.

```
PressHotkey('win','r')
Wait(seconds=1)
Type(text='notepad', interval_seconds=0)
PressHotkey('enter')
Wait(seconds=2)
Type(text='Hello world!', interval_seconds=0.15)
```

This is a simple example that opens Chrome and goes to Google.com.

```
browser = ChromeBrowser()
browser.get('https://google.com')
```

For more and more extensive examples see the folder 'examples'.

## Important notes
For the `Type`-function to work, you need to set the "United States-International" keyboard layout on your system. If the keyboard layout is not available, outcomes of the function might be different.
